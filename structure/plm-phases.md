# PLM Phases

PLM Phases define the high-level steps in the product development lifecycle. They represent time blocks like “Design”, “Sampling”, or “Production”.

Each PLM Template is made up of one or more Phases, which contain Activity Groups and Activities.

## Key Fields

- **Code**: Unique identifier for the phase (e.g., DESIGN, PROD)
- **Description**: Descriptive name of the phase
- **Active**: Indicates whether the phase is available for use
- **Use Color Level**: Visual aid to color-code activities based on timing

## Example Phases

| Code     | Description     |
|----------|-----------------|
| DESIGN   | Design Phase     |
| SAMPLE   | Sampling Phase   |
| PROD     | Production Phase |

## Best Practices

- Define phases that reflect your company’s workflow
- Keep phase names consistent across templates
- Use color coding to visually track progress in plans

> 📌 Note: Changing a Phase does not retroactively affect templates that already use it.
