# PLM Setup

The PLM Setup page controls the foundational configuration of the PLM module in K3 Pebblestone (Gen. 2).  
It defines how PLM Templates and PLM Plans are numbered and ensures consistent structure throughout the lifecycle.

## Key Fields

- **Template No. Series**  
  Defines automatic numbering for PLM Templates (e.g., `PLMT-0001`)

- **PLM Plan No. Series**  
  Defines automatic numbering for PLM Plans (e.g., `PLMP-0001`)

## Best Practices

- Use separate series for templates and plans
- Match format to your internal naming (e.g., PLMT, PLMP)
- Avoid overlap with other modules
