# PLM Overview

The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) module in K3 Pebblestone provides a structured way to manage product development from concept to production.

It is designed to support fashion, apparel, and lifestyle companies that work with collections, styles, and seasons.

## Key Features

- Create PLM Templates with defined phases and activities
- Plan and track product development across multiple items and seasons
- Send notifications automatically based on timelines or delays
- Integrates with PDM (Product Data Management) and standard Business Central item data

## Benefits

- Improved control over product timelines
- Centralized visibility of development stages
- Early detection of delays and planning conflicts
- Stronger alignment between design, development, and purchasing

## Typical Use Cases

- Developing seasonal collections
- Managing style-specific workflows
- Tracking sample production phases
- Coordinating tasks across departments (e.g. design, tech, sourcing)

> Note: PLM Templates define the *structure*, PLM Plans execute it for specific items or collections.
